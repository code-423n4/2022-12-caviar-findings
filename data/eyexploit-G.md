# Unused return value in `_transferFrom()`
There is no way `_transferFrom()` can be failed here, returning true value doesn't make any sense. 
```
    function _transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal returns (bool) {
        balanceOf[from] -= amount;

        // Cannot overflow because the sum of all user
        // balances can't exceed the max uint256 value.
        unchecked {
            balanceOf[to] += amount;
        }

        emit Transfer(from, to, amount);

        return true;
    }
```

*Recommendation :*
avoid them as they can cause an increase in computations (and unnecessary gas consumption).

# Creating new pairs with Clone method is cheaper
```        
File: Caviar.sol
37:   pair = new Pair(nft, baseToken, merkleRoot, pairSymbol, nftName, nftSymbol);
```
`new` keyword in Solidity is used to deploy and creates a new contract instance which is far more expensive than the instances generated by the `Clones`. Clones saves a lot of gas by not deploying the whole new contract.  

Here is the exact timestamp of video uploaded by [openzeppelin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mw-pMmJ7TA&t=1413s), tells how much gas in `UniswapV2Factory.sol` contract can be saved by implementing `Clones` in their code.
