The "create" function allows anyone to create a new "pair" contract by passing in an "nft" contract, a "baseToken" contract, and a "merkleRoot" value. While this is not necessarily a vulnerability, it is important to note that this function can potentially be exploited by an attacker if they are able to create a large number of "pair" contracts and exhaust the contract's gas limit or storage limit. 

function create(address nft, address baseToken, bytes32 merkleRoot) public returns (Pair pair) 

To fix this issue, we can add checks to limit the number of "pair" contracts that can be created by a single user, or add a mechanism to allow users to "pay" for the creation of new "pair" contracts.
